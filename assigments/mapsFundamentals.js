// Maps: Fundamentals
// 13.1
// Create a new book, but this time, as a Map. Assign it to the bookMap
// variable. Use this array as initial data:

const bookMap = new Map([
  ["title", "Clean Code"],
  ["author", "Robert C. Martin"],
]);

console.log(bookMap);

//13.2
// Set a new key in bookMap called pages, and assign it with a number 464.

bookMap.set("pages", 464);

console.log(bookMap);

// 13.3
// Get the title and author values from bookMap,
// and log to the console a string formatted like that: "${title} by ${author}".

const title = bookMap.get("title");
const author = bookMap.get("author");
console.log(`${title} by ${author}`);

// 13.4
// Get the size of bookMap, and log it to the console.
console.log(bookMap.size);

// 13.5
// Check if bookMap has the author key. and if so, log "The author of the book is known"
//  to the console.

if (bookMap.has("author")) console.log("The author of the book is known");
